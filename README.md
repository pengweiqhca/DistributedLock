# DistributedLock

DistributedLock is a .NET library that provides robust and easy-to-use distributed mutexes, reader-writer locks, and semaphores based on a variety of underlying technologies.

With DistributedLock, synchronizing access to a region of code across multiple applications/machines is as simple as:
```C#
await using (await myDistributedLock.AcquireAsync())
{
	// I hold the lock here
}
```

## Implementations

DistributedLock contains implementations based on various technologies; you can install implementation packages individually or just install the [DistributedLock NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DistributedLock) [![NuGet Status](http://img.shields.io/nuget/v/DistributedLock.svg?style=flat)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DistributedLock/), a ["meta" package](https://endjin.com/blog/2020/09/streamline-dependency-management-with-nuget-meta-packages) which includes all implementations as dependencies. *Note that each package is versioned independently according to SemVer*.

## Synchronization primitives

- Locks: provide exclusive access to a region of code
- [Reader-writer locks](docs/Reader-writer%20locks.md): a lock with multiple levels of access. The lock can be held concurrently either by any number of "readers" or by a single "writer".
- [Semaphores](docs/Semaphores.md): similar to a lock, but can be held by up to N users concurrently instead of just one.

While all implementations support locks, the other primitives are only supported by some implementations. See the [implementation-specific documentation pages](docs) for details.

## Basic usage

### Names

Because distributed locks (and other distributed synchronization primitives) are not isolated to a single process, their identity is based on their name which is provided through the constructor. Different underlying technologies have different restrictions on name format; however, DistributedLock largely allows you to ignore these by escaping/hashing names that would otherwise be invalid.

### Acquire

All synchronization primitives support the same basic access pattern. The `Acquire` method returns a "handle" object that represents holding the lock. When the handle is disposed, the lock is released:

```C#
var myDistributedLock = new SqlDistributedLock(name, connectionString); // e. g. if we are using SQL Server
using (myDistributedLock.Acquire())
{
	// we hold the lock here
} // implicit Dispose() call from using block releases it here
```

### TryAcquire

While `Acquire` will block until the lock is available, there is also a `TryAcquire` variant which returns `null` if the lock could not be acquired (due to being held elsewhere):

```C#
using (var handle = myDistributedLock.TryAcquire())
{
	if (handle != null)
	{
		// we acquired the lock :-)
	}
	else
	{
		// someone else has it :-(
	}
}
```

### async support

`async` versions of both of these methods are also supported. These are preferred when you are writing async code since they will not consume a thread while waiting for the lock. If you are using C#8 or higher, you can also dispose of handles asynchronously:

```C#
await using (await myDistributedLock.AcquireAsync()) { ... }
```

### Timeouts

Additionally, all of these methods support an optional `timeout` parameter. `timeout` determines how long `Acquire` will wait before failing with a `TimeoutException` and how long `TryAcquire` will wait before returning null. The default `timeout` for `Acquire` is `Timeout.InfiniteTimeSpan` while for `TryAcquire` the default `timeout` is `TimeSpan.Zero`.

### Cancellation

Finally, the methods take an optional `CancellationToken` parameter, which allows for the acquire operation to be interrupted via cancellation. Note that this won't cancel the hold on the lock once the acquire succeeds.

## Providers

For applications that use [dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection), DistributedLock's providers make it easy to separate out the specification of a lock's (or other primitive's) name from its other settings (such as a database connection string). For example in an ASP.NET Core app you might do:

```C#
// in your Startup.cs:
services.AddSingleton<IDistributedLockProvider>(_ => new PostgresDistributedSynchronizationProvider(myConnectionString));
services.AddTransient<SomeService>();

// in SomeService.cs
public class SomeService
{
	private readonly IDistributedLockProvider _synchronizationProvider;

	public SomeService(IDistributedLockProvider synchronizationProvider)
	{
		this._synchronizationProvider = synchronizationProvider;
	}
	
	public void InitializeUserAccount(int id)
	{
		// use the provider to construct a lock
		var @lock = this._synchronizationProvider.CreateLock($"UserAccount{id}");
		using (@lock.Acquire())
		{
			// do stuff
		}
		
		// ALTERNATIVELY, for common use-cases extension methods allow this to be done with a single call
		using (this._synchronizationProvider.AcquireLock($"UserAccount{id}"))
		{
			// do stuff
		}
	}
}
```
